        <p1 class="para1">I truly love you so dearly and yea this took me quite a while to make but its nothing much y'know. I wish you a holly jolly Christmas and I wish I could've spent it with you by being next to you but I guess that still has time hehe. Well here are a few reasons why you should choose me as your Christmas gift for the next eternity:</p1>
        <p2 class="para2">1. Rizz since childhood and has Masters in Quantum Rizzics with papers published on research about Einstein's Photo-Elecrizz Effect.</p2>
        <div class="container"></div>
        <div class="container1"></div>
        <img src="img/pic1.png" class="pic1" />
        <p3 class="para3">2. Really cool and creative asf! Will make lots of creative gifts for you like these with as much effort as he can give!</p3>
        <img src="img/cool.png" id="btn3" class="pic2" />
        <div class="container2"></div>
        <p4 class="para4">3. Rare asl, won't find anywhere else! A rather stereotypical INFJ male which is VERY hard to find. Only about 0.5-1% of males in this world are INFJ. (But I'm still one in 8 billion.)</p4>
        <img src="img/infj.png" class="pic3" />
        <div class="container3"></div>
        <p5 class="para5">4. Hopefully a future IITian about whom you can flex around! Parents will accept him as your fianc√© wholeheartedly. Will win them over for you too.</p5>
        <img src="img/smiley.png" class="pic4" />
        <div class="container4"></div>
        <p6 class="para6">5. Loyal and shows black cat behaviour! He will still become a toddler for you 'cause you have some sort of magic apparently but promises to be there for you always. </p6>
        <img src="img/cat.jpg" class="pic5" />
        <p7 class="para7">These are just 5 reasons but I could name a lot more if you'd like lmso. Also Psst, I have hidden 3 buttons on this website with the three magic words. If you find them all, you'll get a reward!</p7>
        <div data-speedx="0.04" data-speedy="0.05" class="parallax container5"></div>
        <button id="btn1" class="button1">
            <span class="button_top">
                Click Here
            </span>
        </button>
        <canvas class="c3"></canvas>
        <p8 class="para8">There's one right above, click it! The other two you needa find yourself though.</p8>
        <p9 id="m1" class="msg1">i</p9>
        <p10 id="m2" class="msg2">love</p10>
